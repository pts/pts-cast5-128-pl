Crypt::CAST5_128_PP: CAST5 block cipher with 128-bit key in pure Perl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Crypt::CAST5_128_PP is a Perl module which provides a pure Perl
implementation of the CAST5 block cipher. CAST5 is also known as CAST-128.
Crypt::CAST5_128_PP has simplified implementation which supports key size of
128 bits only. Use Crypt::CAST5_128_PP if you need all key sizes (40 .. 128
bits, divisible by 8).

CAST5 is product of the CAST design procedure developed by C. Adams and S.
Tavares. It is available royalty-free.
